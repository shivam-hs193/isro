This report presents a detailed system-level study of architectural enhancements to the IDRSS communication network with the objective of improving operational efficiency, eliminating foreign ground station dependency, and ensuring reliable relay support for the GY spacecraft under existing mission constraints.

The study proposes a baseline reconfiguration of IDRSS-2, in which inter-satellite Ka-band communication is established between IDRSS-2 and IDRSS-1. This architecture consolidates all ground communication through the domestic ground station associated with IDRSS-1, thereby removing the requirement for foreign ground infrastructure. Analytical RF link budget evaluation demonstrates that the additional distance associated with GEO-to-GEO relay is compensated by reduced data rate requirements and elimination of atmospheric losses. STK-based visibility analysis further confirms that the GY spacecraft maintains continuous access to at least one IDRSS satellite, validating the operational feasibility of the proposed relay concept. The baseline proposal therefore provides a technically sound and operationally efficient method for achieving the primary mission objectives without requiring major payload redesign.

To enhance system capability further, an alternate repeater-based architecture was also investigated. This configuration introduces an intermediate GEO repeater satellite to enable continuous two-way ground-to-user communication during all visibility conditions. Detailed geometric and link-margin analysis confirms that such a configuration is technically achievable through antenna scaling localized within the repeater satellite, while preserving the functional integrity of IDRSS-1, IDRSS-2, and the GY spacecraft. The repeater-based architecture provides a scalable and future-ready extension of the IDRSS system and demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed relay framework.

Under the present mission constraints, implementation of either proposal requires additional programmatic or system-level considerations. However, both architectures collectively establish a technically validated design space that significantly expands operational options for the IDRSS network. Should future mission priorities demand uninterrupted two-way commanding or expanded relay capability, the repeater-based solution provides a clearly defined upgrade path. If operational or implementation constraints prevent adoption of either architecture, reversion to foreign ground station support remains available as a contingency option.

In summary, this study demonstrates that strategic reconfiguration of relay architecture can achieve substantial operational improvements while minimizing modifications to existing mission assets. The proposed solutions establish a flexible, scalable, and forward-compatible framework for IDRSS evolution, supporting both current mission requirements and potential future expansion of relay capabilities.
