11. Benefits and Drawbacks of the Repeater-Based Architecture (Revised)
11.1 Benefits of the Repeater-Based Architecture
11.1.1 Continuous Two-Way Ground-to-User Connectivity
Enables uninterrupted forward telecommand and return telemetry between the ground station and the GY spacecraft under all visibility conditions.
Eliminates periods of autonomous-only operation when the GY spacecraft is visible exclusively to IDRSS-2.
Supports mission scenarios requiring real-time commanding, contingency handling, or rapid response.
11.1.2 Minimal and Localized Changes to Existing Systems
No modifications required to:
IDRSS-1 payload, antennas, or RF chains
GY spacecraft communication subsystem
Limited and well-defined change on IDRSS-2:
Replacement of the 1.5 m Ka/Ku antenna with a 1.5 m Ka/S antenna
No change in antenna size, pointing, or mechanical interface
Avoids any redesign of:
High-power amplifiers
User link interfaces
Onboard processing chains
11.1.3 Concentration of Complexity within the Repeater Satellite
Majority of new complexity (large antennas, additional RF chains) is confined to the repeater satellite.
Simplifies impact assessment by isolating major technical risks to a single new spacecraft.
Enables independent development, qualification, and launch of the repeater satellite.
11.1.4 Architecturally Scalable Solution
Provides a modular enhancement path if continuous two-way commanding becomes a firm mission requirement.
Architecture can support additional relay functions or extended user coverage with minimal changes to existing satellites.
Maintains long-term flexibility without re-architecting the IDRSS system.
11.2 Drawbacks of the Repeater-Based Architecture
11.2.1 Increased System Complexity and Cost
Introduction of an additional spacecraft increases:
Development and qualification cost
Launch and integration cost
Mission planning and coordination effort
Requires additional programmatic oversight and schedule margin.
11.2.2 Large and Asymmetric Antenna Requirements on the Repeater
Repeater must accommodate large Ka-band deployable antennas, especially toward IDRSS-2.
Asymmetric antenna sizing leads to:
Increased structural and mechanical complexity
Higher mass and stowage volume
More stringent deployment reliability requirements
Narrow Ka-band beamwidth imposes tight pointing accuracy and stability constraints.
11.2.3 Additional Operational and Reliability Considerations
Repeater introduces an additional operational element requiring monitoring and control.
Potential single-point dependency for continuous forward commanding, although:
Baseline data relay capability remains available in case of repeater unavailability.
Increased complexity in fault detection, isolation, and recovery planning.
11.2.4 Limited Incremental Benefit Over the Baseline Configuration
The baseline proposal already achieves:
Continuous user data relay
Elimination of foreign ground station dependency
Avoidance of orbital relocation
The repeater primarily adds value by restoring forward telecommand during specific visibility conditions, which may not justify the additional cost and complexity for all mission scenarios.
11.3 Overall Assessment
The repeater-based alternate proposal provides a technically robust solution for achieving continuous two-way ground-to-user communication. While it introduces a minor architectural modification on IDRSS-2—specifically the replacement of the 1.5 m Ka/Ku antenna with a Ka/S antenna—the majority of additional complexity is concentrated within the repeater satellite.
When evaluated against the mission objectives already satisfied by the baseline configuration, the repeater architecture is best positioned as a future enhancement or contingency option, rather than the preferred baseline solution.
